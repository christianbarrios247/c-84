									<h2><a href="#">Christian Barrios</a></h2>
									<p>Hi, welcome to my personal page! I am a mechanical engineer who graduated from California State University, 
										Los Angeles on May 2022. I am very interested in the aerospace, robotics, and technology industry. This is where I will be 
										uploading some of the projects I have worked on. These 
										projects include CAD models and simulations such as FEA Analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and 
										Thermal Simulations. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. My contact information 
										is on the bottom of the page. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 1:<br />
										Senior Capstone Project</a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src= Rover_Life.jpg alt="" /></a> <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src= CAD_model.png alt="" /></a>
									<p>One of my major tasks for my senior capstone project was to use Solidworks to make a CAD model of the robotic arm.
										Once the model was completed, it was used by the software team for programming. </p>

											Thermal Analysis & Computational Fluid Dynamics </a> </h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=cfd-simulation.jpg alt="" /></a> <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=cfd-with-flow-trajecties.jpg alt="" /></a> 
									<p> The objective of the simulations was to determine whether enough air was going to cool down the electronics
										within the compartment box. Since the competition is located in Utah, the air cooling would have to be working 
										at its maximum. Another thing that had to be verified was if the electronics were going to function in the heat.
										Utilizing Flow Simulation on Solidworks, I was able to determine the airflow through the electronic compartment box.
										Different variations of the CFD was created using different fan placements using configurations. It was determined that 
										the fans located opposite each other was more effective when minimizing hot spots within the compartment box. Next, a thermal 
										analysis was conducted to determine if each electronic was going to overheat due to the environment temperature. Once the simulation 
										was completed, it was determined that each component was going to operate within their operating temperature ranges that were
										found in the data sheets.

										<h2><a href="#">Project 3:<br />
										Propeller Design</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=propeller-design.jpg alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project was to create a propeller design for ENGR 1500: Introduction to Engineering.
										In this competition, a group of students created their own propeller designs. 
										Research was done to determine how many blades would be sufficient for speed and power. I modeled my design
										using Solidworks to create the model with different blade count, area, thickness, and angle of twist.
										 In my design, 4 blades were included since it adds durabilty however, it will lose speed. Since the propeller
										was going to be tested in water on a ROV, I made sure to it was gonna be durable since the product was going 
										to be 3D printed.

										<h2><a href="#">Project 4<br />
										NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=Polaris-17.jpg alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, a rover was designed using Siemens NX to make a CAD model that was created to perform 
										certain tasks on the moon. In this mission concept, the rover is suppose to withstand moonquakes, able to 
										drive around the terrain without any trouble, and lastly to withstand the radiation emmitted by the sun.
										On the CAD model, power tools were also added onto the model to perform the requirements to drill onto the surface 
										of the moon and drill and collect rocks. In this model, I assisted with the design of the cameras and the suspension system. 
										The suspension system that I was able to create was the Rocker-Bogie because it would be able to drive around a rocky terrain. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 5:<br />
										Flashlight Design</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=flashlight.jpg alt="" /></a> <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=flashlight-drawing.jpg alt="" /></a>
									<p> The purpose of this project was to get experience using Solidworks and being able to manufactue the product 
										using a mill and lathe. A Solidworks model and drawing was created and once the
										drawings were approved by the professor, I was able to start manufacturing the Flashlight. Before working on the
									machines, I was taught how to safely operate the machines. Once the manufacturing was completed, I assembled the 
								flashlight together and it was fully functional.   </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Finite Element Analysis (FEA):<br />
										Non-Linear Analysis</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=FEA.jpg alt="" /></a> 
									<p> Before performing an FEA, I took an informational course on FEA that taught me what it is 
										and how to use it in different situations. After finishing the course, I recieved a certification and feel prepared
										to use FEA on any part. During the course, I was provided with CAD models such as a connecting
									rod from a piston engine. FEA is important because it helps provide how much stress a part can handle.
								The part that I have modeled on Solidworks is a dog-boned shaped specimen made out of Aluminum 6061 T-6. This analysis was used
							to compare experimental data in my Strength of Materials Laboratory. The material Al 6061 T-6 was used in an Universal Testing machine
						which provided data on the properties of the specimen undergoing tension. After performing the analysis, I compared both results and determined
					that both ultimate tensile strength are very similar and can safely assume that the material test on the UTM was in fact Aluminum 6061 T-6.  </p>
