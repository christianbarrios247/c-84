									<h2><a href="#">Christian Barrios</a></h2>
									<p>Hi, welcome to my personal page! I am a mechanical engineer who graduated from California State University, 
										Los Angeles in May 2022. This is where I will be uploading some of the projects I have worked on. These 
										projects include CAD models and simulations such as FEA Analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and 
										Thermal Simulations. Please feel free to contact me with any questiosns. My contact information 
										is on the bottom of the page. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 1:<br />
										Senior Capstone Project</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src= scorbot-arm.jpg alt="" /></a> <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src= scorbot-actual.jpg alt="" /></a>
									<p>One of my major tasks for my senior capstone project was to use Solidworks to make a CAD model of the robotic arm.
										Once the model was completed, it was used by the software team for programming. </p>

											Thermal Analysis & Computational Fluid Dynamics </a> </h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=cfd-simulation.jpg alt="" /></a> <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=cfd-with-flow-trajecties.jpg alt="" /></a> 
									<p> The objective of the simulations was to determine whether enough air was going to cool down the electronics
										within the compartment box. Since the competition is located in Utah, the air cooling would have to be working 
										at its maximum. Another thing that had to be verified was if the electronics were going to function in the heat.
										Utilizing Flow Simulation on Solidworks, I was able to determine the airflow through the electronic compartment box.
										Different variations of the CFD was created using different fan placements using configurations. It was determined that 
										the fans located opposite each other was more effective when minimizing hot spots within the compartment box. Next, a thermal 
										analysis was conducted to determine if each electronic was going to overheat due to the environment temperature. Once the simulation 
										was completed, it was determined that each component was going to operate within their operating temperature ranges that were
										found in the data sheets.

										<h2><a href="#">Project 3:<br />
										Propeller Design</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=propeller-design.jpg alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project was to create a propeller design for ENGR 1500: Introduction to Engineering.
										In this competition, a group of students created their own propeller designs. 
										Research was done to determine how many blades would be sufficient for speed and power. I modeled my design
										using Solidworks to create the model with different blade count, area, thickness, and angle of twist.
										 In my design, 4 blades were included since it adds durabilty however, it will lose speed. Since the propeller
										was going to be tested in water on a ROV, I made sure to it was gonna be durable since the product was going 
										to be 3D printed.

										<h2><a href="#">Project 4<br />
										L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src=Polaris-17.jpg alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, a rover was designed using Siemens NX to make a CAD model that was created to perform 
										certain tasks on the moon. In this mission concept, the rover is suppose to withstand moonquakes, able to 
										drive around the terrain without any trouble, and lastly to withstand the radiation emmitted by the sun.
										On the CAD model, power tools were also added onto the model to perform the requirements to drill onto the surface 
										of the moon and drill and collect rocks. In this model, I assisted with the design of the cameras and the suspension system. 
										The suspension system that I was able to create was the Rocker-Bogie because it would be able to drive around a rocky terrain. </p>
